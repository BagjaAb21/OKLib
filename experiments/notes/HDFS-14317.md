### HDFS-14317
In this case, the standby namenode does not trigger edit log rolling when in-progress edit log tailing is enabled.

#### Modify config
We assume the hostnames of 5 nodes are NODE1, NODE2, NODE3, NODE4 and NODE5. Please replace the hostnames in the commands with yours.

In `experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14317/workers`

```
NODE3
NODE4
NODE5
```


In `experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14317/hdfs-site.xml`
```
<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.rpc-address.razor.nn1</name>
  <value>NODE1:8020</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.rpc-address.razor.nn2</name>
  <value>NODE2:8020</value>
</property>
```

#### Run commands (~15min)

Run these commands on all nodes:

```bash
experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14317/install_HDFS-14317.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP]
``` 

```bash
./run_engine.sh install conf/samples/hdfs-3.2.1.properties hdfs
```

```bash
experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14317/trigger_HDFS-14317.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP] NODE1 NODE2
```

Then you can checkout logs `hadoop/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT/logs/*.log`, if you see NODE1 stops generating 
```
INFO org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.EditLogTailer: Triggering log roll on remote NameNode
```
That means reproducing succeed (you should probably check after more than 2min).

Check the `hadoop/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT/logs/*.out` to see detection report for failed invariants. If invariants giving alerts, the detection is successful.



#### Shut down instances and Clean up 

```bash
experiments/run/hdfs/cleanup.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP] NODE1
```
