### HDFS-14514

This case reproduces changed snapshot files. 

#### Run commands (~10min)

Run these commands on single node to prepare the system:
```bash
experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14514/install_HDFS-14514.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP]
./run_engine.sh install conf/samples/hdfs-3.2.1.properties hdfs_14514
```

Run the reproduction script:
```bash
experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14514/trigger_HDFS-14514.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP]
```

If successfully reproduced, you should see output as below, containing a line of "Not Equal!".

Check the `hadoop/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-2.10.0-SNAPSHOT/logs/*.out` to see detection report for failed invariants. If invariants giving alerts, the detection is successful.

#### Cleanup

The script starts and shuts down HDFS automatically. Check `jps` to see if there is any process not successfully terminated.

Cleanup execution data:
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/hdfs-14514-repro
```
