### HDFS-14633
In this case, the rename operation succeeded despite with set quota limits.

#### Modify config
We assume the hostnames of 5 nodes are NODE1, NODE2, NODE3, NODE4 and NODE5. Please replace the hostnames in the commands with yours.

In `experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14633/core-site.xml`

```
<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>hdfs://NODE1:8020</value>            # change to first node in cluster
</property>
```

In `experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14633/workers`

```
NODE1
NODE2
NODE3
NODE4
NODE5
```

#### Run commands (~15min)

Run these commands on all nodes:

```bash
experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14633/install_HDFS-14633.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP]
./run_engine.sh install conf/samples/hdfs-3.2.1.properties hdfs

```

Run only on NODE1:
```bash
experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14633/trigger_HDFS-14633.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP]
```

If you see no errors instead of request is rejected (that's what you should see if quota make indeed effects), this means the failure is reproduced.

Check the `hadoop/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT/logs/*.out` to see detection report for failed invariants. If invariants giving alerts, the detection is successful.


#### Shut down instances and Clean up 

```bash
experiments/run/hdfs/cleanup.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP] NODE1
```
