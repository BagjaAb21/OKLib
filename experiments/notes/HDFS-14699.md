### HDFS-14699

This case reproduces failures of missing redundancy blocks. 


#### Modify config (<1min)
We assume the hostnames of 5 nodes are NODE1, NODE2, NODE3, NODE4 and NODE5. Please replace the hostnames in the commands with yours.

In `experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14699/core-site.xml`

```
<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>hdfs://NODE1:8020</value>            # change to first node in cluster
</property>
```

In `experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14699/hdfs-site.xml`

```
    <property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.secondary.http-address</name>
    <value>NODE2:50090</value>                # secondary namenode is optional
  </property>
  ...
    <property>
<name>dfs.hosts.exclude</name>
<value>/home/chang/hadoop/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT/etc/hadoop/dfs.exclude</value>
</property>
```

In `experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14699/workers`

```
NODE1
NODE2
NODE3
NODE4
NODE5
```

#### Run commands (~20min)

Run these commands on all nodes:

```bash
experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14699/install_HDFS-14699.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP]
./run_engine.sh install conf/samples/hdfs-3.2.1.properties hdfs
experiments/run/hdfs/cleanup.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP] NODE1
```

Run only on NODE1:
```bash
experiments/reproduce/HDFS-14699/trigger_HDFS-14699.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP] NODE3 NODE4 NODE5
```


The scripts would automatically return results for `bin/hdfs fsck /test -files -blocks -replicaDetails` and you should see live blocks only have two, while other one is redundant if failure successfully reproduced, like:

```
/test/foo 6021985 bytes, erasure-coded: policy=XOR-2-1-1024k, 1 block(s):  Under replicated BP-324935606-128.110.217.68-1649978575465:blk_-9223372036854775792_1001. Target Replicas is 3 but found 2 live replica(s), 0 decommissioned replica(s), 0 decommissioning replica(s).

```

Check the `hadoop/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT/logs/*.out` to see detection report for failed invariants. If invariants giving alerts, the detection is successful.


#### Shut down instances and Clean up 

```bash
experiments/run/hdfs/cleanup.sh [path_to_OathKeeper] [path_to_HADOOP] NODE1
```
